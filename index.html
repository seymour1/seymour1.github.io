<p>I'm a Ph.D. student of Computer Science at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) where I perform research at the intersection of machine learning and information security under the supervision of Dr. Charles Nicholas. My tentative Ph.D. dissertation topic is quantifying value in open source malware datasets. In 2014, I completed my Masterâ€™s thesis, titled "Quantum Classification of Malware", which was later presented at DEFCON 23. I currently perform machine learning and security research at ZeroFOX, Inc.</p>

<p>I am also a recent alum of UMBC (Fall 2011). I have three undergraduate degrees: a B.S. in Computer Science, a B.S. in Mathematics, and a B.A. in Philosophy (All cum laude). During my undergraduate career, I completed the UMBC Honors College program, studied abroad for a semester at the University of Bristol (UK), published two conference papers, held a fair number of internships, qualified for the UMBC Fencing Team, and became a member of the honor societies ODK and PME.</p>
